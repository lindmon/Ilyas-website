                    <p class="abstract-text">Zero-interest green loan programs (ZIGL) are gaining traction to address the tremendous financing needs implied by climate change mitigation. One such program, the French Éco-Prêt à Taux Zéro, significantly under-performed the expectations the government had for it at its inception in 2009. Using an event-study design applied to a panel survey of 10,000 households, we find that the program had a substantial, yet short-lived, impact on home energy retrofits. On the extensive margin, eligibility to the program significantly increased the rate of renovation by 3-4 percentage points (+20-25\%) in the first two years, but not thereafter. The effect is strongest (8pp) for low-income homeowners. On the intensive margin, we find a low effect both in terms of additional actions per renovation and additional spending. Our results are robust to a range of robustness checks, including placebo regressions and propensity score weighting. We explore the reasons for the program under-performance from both demand and supply sides. On the demand side, we point towards institutional and macroeconomic factors that can explain the lack of take-up. On the supply side, we study banks' opportunity costs of providing ZIGLs instead of consumption or housing loans. We find that banks decrease ZIGL provision by 5\% following a 1 percentage point rise in the opportunity cost, suggesting that monetary incentive is crucial for zero-interest green loan programs to work.</p>

                    <p class="abstract-text"> I study decentralization of optimal allocations in an endowment OLG economy where private agents face endogenous borrowing constraints. Lenders constrain credit because of limited commitment of borrowers: they can declare bankruptcy and only lose the ability to make savings for retirement in the future. The social planner can use lump-sum transfers and government debt in order to decentralize optimal allocations of consumption goods. I show that policies using government debt decentralize a larger set of optimal allocations, as opposed to balanced-budget policies with the same number of instruments. In addition, government debt rules out suboptimal equilibria where the private credit market does not operate. %Both of these positive effects are due to an increase of interest rates associated with the use of government debt. 
The results are explained by incentives to saving and debt repayment under limited commitment, so they do not hold under common specifications of exogenous debt constraints.  </p>

                    <p class="abstract-word">+ Abstract</p>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="abstract-container">
                    <p class="abstract-text"> We consider an OLG\ growth model with imperfect capital markets where borrowers
cannot credibly commit to repay their loans. Default can happen in equilibrium, which excludes the possibility of saving for old age of the defaulter. Lenders compensate the default risk with an interest rate premium, making interest differ from the return on physical capital. Defaulters who are excluded from the formal credit market have
access to a bubbly asset. We show the existence of a bubbly equilibrium with a
fraction of agents that make default. For such an equilibrium, there exist
three interest rates in the economy: the interest rate on loans, which is
higher that the interest rate for lenders, which exceeds the one on the bubbly
asset. This implies that the rental rate of capital is higher than the growth
rate of GDP: bubbles existence is associated with underaccumulation. A bubbly steady state always co-exists with a bubbleless one. Existence of bubbles does not rely on capital overaccumulation in the bubbleless steady state. In case where capital is overaccumulated, the bubbly steady-state is generically not optimal since it is associated with additional defaults.
